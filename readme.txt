Security plugin to request minimum requirements in user passwords

== Description ==
Enforce Password Strength is a WordPress plugin that allows administrators to set minimum security requirements based on type and number of characters for user account passwords. In this way, during registration, the change or reset of the password will be allowed to continue only if the set requirements are met; in addition, the requirements will be verified during login, and an immediate reset will be required if these requirements are not currently met

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin via the default "Add plugin" page.
2. Go to "Enforce Password Strength" settings page to set the minimum security requirement you want on your site
